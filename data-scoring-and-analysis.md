Scoring and Analysis of Data
----------------------------

* Data Scoring

 	Data is scored after it is entered and verified by study staff.
 	The primary tool for scoring is SASÂ© software. Programs are 
 	custom-designed for the individual measure and study, as to ensure
 	proper scoring and emphasis of results. Depending on the data 
 	collection software used by the study, scoring tools can also be
 	naturally integrated into the collection process.

* Data Analysis

 	After being electronically and hand scored, the resulting data 
 	sets are then handed off to various staff members including the
 	study coordinator and statisticians who then analyze the data for
 	results.
