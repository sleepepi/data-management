Collection and Entry of Data
----------------------------

* Data Entry Process

 	Data is given to unblinded study staff members to enter 
 	electronically in a timely manner after visits. Most data is
 	entered and saved within 7 days of the study visit; all data is 
 	entered within 2 weeks of the visit date.

Verification of Data
--------------------

* Data Verification Process

	Data is verified in one of two ways:

	1) Data is entered once by one study staff member, who would mark 
 	it as 'Ready to be reviewed' electronically and then is reviewed 
 	in a timely manner by a second study staff member and compared to 
 	the original data. The second staff memeber will then make any
 	necessary corrections and mark it as 'Completed' or 'Reviewed'.

 	2) In the second verification method, double data entry is 
 	utilized. Two staff members will enter identical data sets into 
 	the collection instruments, and a third staff member will then
 	compare the two entries for discrepancies, make corrections, and
 	then merge them into one complete, verified file.
