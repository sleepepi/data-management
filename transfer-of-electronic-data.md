Transfer of electronic data
===============

Certain study data (e.g. physiological measures such as overnight sleep testing, wrist or hip actigraphy, pulse oximetry, etc.) require additional means of transfer beyond CRF completion and entry into the EDC system. Typically the raw data will be sent to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for further processing and inclusion into study databases.

### Method of transfer

Each study site will receive a username and password to access a DCC file server using SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). This file server is setup and managed by Partners Enterprise Applications and is hosted within the Partners Healthcare data center, which affords it the same security protections as Partners clinical data.
