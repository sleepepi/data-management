Data Storage Procedures and Conventions
=======================================


 Storing of Data
 ---------------

 * Form Design and Storage

 	Forms are designed in a standard manner. The forms always contain 
 	a header section, generally consisting of patient-specific 
 	information (ie. study ID number, namecode, date of measurement,
 	etc.). This header section is then followed by the actual fields
 	on the form. Questionnaires are distributed and administered 
 	either in person at the visit, or via US mail with a prepaid 
 	return  envelope. Forms that are filled out at the time of the 
 	visit are stored in subject binders until the time of the visit. 
 	Electronic copies of all forms are stored on the Program's server 
 	share for study staff to access and download as needed. Older 
 	versions of forms are archived on the server with their date or 
 	version number appended to the title for ease of identification.

* Data Storage

 	Data files will be stored logically under 
 	a data folder on the Sleep Medicine Epidemiology Program's 10 
 	terabyte server share, managed at the Needham Data Center site, 
 	organized by data type, subject, and visit.
