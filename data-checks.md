Data Checks
===========

Overview
--------
Data checks are an important quality control measure in maintaining a clinical dataset. Frequent and regular data checking identifies potentially problematic or missing values in close enough proximity to data collection that the discrepancy can be rectified more easily than at the conclusion of the study. The appropriate interval for performing data checks will vary by project, but typically data checks occur weekly, biweekly or monthly. In addition to regular checks, periodic checks may be requested by study investigators for specific data. In these cases, data queries are forwarded from staff members to members of the Research Informatics department.

Process
----------------
Custom programs are written to analyze electronically stored data for discrepancies including outlier values, missing or unverified forms and data fields, and the overall state of data collection and entry. Reports are generated from these programs and then distributed to the appropriate study staff members, who then correct or verify the error. Reports are then regenerated to verify the correction.

Mechanisms
----------

#### Software
There are many statistical software packages available to aid in data checking. These include:

1. SAS. In the Division of Sleep Medicine Epidemiology, SASÂ© is the software package used most frequently in data checking. SAS has strong data handling capabilities and is able to process large, rectangular datasets efficiently. Because data checking often involves checking the values of multiple variables across multiple observations (or subjects), SAS is useful in this process.

2. R.
