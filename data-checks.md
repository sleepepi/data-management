Data Checks
===========

Overview
--------
Data checks are an important quality control measure in maintaining a clinical dataset. Frequent and regular data checking identifies potentially problematic or missing values in close enough proximity to data collection that the discrepancy can be rectified more easily than at the conclusion of the study. The appropriate interval for performing data checks will vary by project, but typically data checks occur weekly, biweekly or monthly. In addition to regular checks, periodic checks may be requested by study investigators for specific data. In these cases, data queries are forwarded from staff members to members of the Research Informatics department.

SASÂ© is the primary program utilized in data queries. Custom programs are written to analyze electronically stored data for discrepancies including outlier values, missing or unverified forms and data fields, and the overall state of data collection and entry. Reports are generated from these programs and then distributed to the appropriate study staff members, who then correct or verify the error. Reports are then regenerated to verify the correction.
