Data Checks
===========

Overview
--------
  Data queries are forwarded from staff members to members of the
  Research Informatics department. SASÂ© is the primary program
  utilized in data queries. Custom programs are written to analyze
  electronically stored data for discrepancies including outlier
  values, missing or unverified forms and data fields, and the
  overall state of data collection and entry. Reports are generated
  from these programs and then distributed to the appropriate study
  staff members, who then correct or verify the error. Reports are
  then regenerated to verify the correction.
